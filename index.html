    <h1>Intro to Git</h1>

    <h2>What&rsquo;s a version control system?</h2>
    <p>A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects
        together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence
        that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which changes were made?</li>
        <li>Who made the changes?</li>
        <li>When were the changes made?</li>
        <li>Why were changes needed?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>What&rsquo;s a distributed version control system?</h2>
    <p>Git is an example of a distributed version control
        system (DVCS) commonly used for open source and commercial software development. DVCSs allow full access to
        every file, branch, and iteration of a project, and allows every user access to a full and self-contained
        history of all changes.</p>
    <p>Without version control, team members are subject to
        redundant tasks, slower timelines, and multiple copies of a single project. To eliminate unnecessary work,
        Git and other VCSs give each contributor a unified and consistent view of a project, surfacing work
        that&rsquo;s already in progress. Seeing a transparent history of changes, who made them, and how they
        contribute to the development of a project helps team members stay aligned while working
        independently.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why Git?</h2>
    <p>According to the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology"><u>Stack
                Overflow developer
                survey</u></a>, more than 70 percent of developers use Git,
        making it the most-used VCS in the world. Git is commonly used for both open source and commercial software
        development, with significant benefits for individuals, teams and businesses.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What&rsquo;s a repository?</h2>
    <p>A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire
        collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file&rsquo;s revision history.
        The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list
        relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Because Git is a
        DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the
        entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository
        also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing
        changes across versions of code, and more.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Basic Git commands</h2>
    <p>To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine
        code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like <a
            href="https://desktop.github.com"><u>GitHub Desktop</u></a> or Git Kraken. Here are some common commands for
        using
        Git:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>git init</code> initializes a brand new Git repository and begins
            tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the
            internal data structure required for version control.</li>

        <li><code>git clone</code> creates a local copy of
            a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project&rsquo;s files, history,
            and branches.</li>

        <li><code>git add</code> stages a change. Git tracks changes to a
            developer&rsquo;s codebase, but it&rsquo;s necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to
            include them in the project&rsquo;s history. This command performs staging, the first part of that
            two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the
            project&rsquo;s history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the
            history of their project without changing how they code and work.</li>

        <li><code>git commit</code> saves the snapshot to the project history and
            completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything
            that&rsquo;s been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit.</li>

        <li><code>git status</code> shows the status of changes as untracked, modified,
            or staged.</li>

        <li><code>git branch</code> shows the branches being worked on locally.
        </li>

        <li><code>git merge</code> merges lines of development together. This command is
            typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge
            when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment.</li>

        <li><code>git pull</code> updates the local line of development with updates from
            its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a
            remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.</li>

        <li><code>git push</code> updates the remote repository with any commits made
            locally to a branch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Intro to GitHub</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/"><u>GitHub</u></a> is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
        It lets you
        and others work together on projects from anywhere.</p>
    <p>This guide teaches you GitHub essentials like
        repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You&rsquo;ll create your own Hello World repository and
        learn GitHub&rsquo;s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
    <p>To complete this tutorial, you need a <a href="http://github.com/"><u>GitHub
                account</u></a> and Internet access. You don&rsquo;t need to know how to code. Installation
        of Git (the version control software GitHub is built on) is necessary. Some knowledge about command line
        will be a plus.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Step 1. Create a Repository</h2>
    <p>A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images,
        videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. I would recommend including a README, or a
        file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new
        repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.</p>
    <p>Your hello-world repository can be a
        place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things
        with others.</p>
    <h3>To create a new repository</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click and then select New Repository</li>
        <li>Name your repository hello-world</li>
        <li>Write a short description</li>
        <li>Select Add a README file</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="assets/images/create-repo.png" alt="Creating a new repository">
    <p>Click Create repository.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Step 2. Clone the repository</h2>
    <p>When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create
        a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.</p>
    <h3>About cloning a repository</h3>
    <p>You can clone a repository from GitHub to your local computer to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or
        remove files, and push larger commits. When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub to your
        local machine.</p>
    <p>Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time,
        including all versions of every file and folder for the project. You can push your changes to the remote
        repository on GitHub, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.</p>
    <p>You can clone your existing repository or clone another person's existing repository to contribute to a project.
